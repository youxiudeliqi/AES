A caching strategy to improve streaming graph partitioning performance
Graph partitioning is one of important method to accelerate large distributed graphs computation. Streaming graph partitioning is more efficient compared with offline partitioning, it has been developed continuously in the application of graph partitioning in recent years. In this work, we first introduce a heuristic greedy streaming partitioning and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art streaming partitioning methods, leading to exact balance and lower cut. Secondly, we introduce a cache structure for streaming partitioning, called adjacent edge structure, which can improve the partition efficiency several times on single commodity type computer without affecting the partition quality. No matter whether the memory capacity has limitation (local cache) or not (global cache), our strategy is also can improve the partition quality by restreaming partitioning. Take Linear Weight Greedy Streaming algorithm as an example, even if the dynamic cache capacity is set to 1% of the graph size, it can still keep lower fraction of edges cut, which proves the effectiveness and superiority of cache structure mentioned in this paper.
